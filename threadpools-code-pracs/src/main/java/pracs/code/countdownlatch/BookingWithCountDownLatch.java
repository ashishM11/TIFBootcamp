* Imagine a movie theater where:

The movie will not start until all customers have booked their seats.

There is one screen manager (main thread) waiting for a signal: ‚ÄúAll seats booked!‚Äù

Multiple ticket agents (threads) are handling bookings in parallel.

We use a CountDownLatch to make the main thread wait until all bookings are complete.
