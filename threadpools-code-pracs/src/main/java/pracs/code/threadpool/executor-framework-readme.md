## Executor Framework:<hr/>


**The Executor Framework in Java is a powerful tool introduced in Java 5, designed to simplify and enhance multithreading.**<br/>
**It decouples task submission from execution, allowing for more efficient and manageable concurrency.**<br/>
**Instead of creating and managing threads directly, developers can submit tasks to an executor, which handles the thread lifecycle.**<br/><br/>


**Key components of the Executor Framework:**<br/><br/>

**Executor Interface:**<br/><br/>
The base interface with a single method, execute(Runnable command), for submitting tasks.<br/>

**ExecutorService Interface:**<br/><br/>
Extends Executor, providing methods to manage task execution, submit tasks, and retrieve results.<br/>

**ThreadPoolExecutor:**<br/><br/>
A concrete class that implements ExecutorService, offering various thread pool configurations.<br/>

**ScheduledExecutorService:**<br/><br/>
Extends ExecutorService to schedule tasks for delayed or periodic execution.<br/>

**Executors Utility Class:**<br/><br/>
Provides factory methods to create different types of thread pools, such as fixed, cached, and single-threaded.<br/>
