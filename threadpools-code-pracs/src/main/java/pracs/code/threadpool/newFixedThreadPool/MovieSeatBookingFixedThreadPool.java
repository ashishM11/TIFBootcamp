/*
    Simulating a fixed number of ticket agents (threads) handling multiple booking requests (tasks), with customers waiting in line (queue) when all agents are busy.

    What This Code Does:

       1. Only 3 threads (agents) work concurrently ‚Äî pool-1-thread-1, -2, -3.

       2. The rest of the customers wait in a queue.

       3. Once an agent finishes one booking, they immediately take the next from the queue.

       4. No new threads are created beyond 3.
